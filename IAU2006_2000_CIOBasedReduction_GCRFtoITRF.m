%% FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:
% The following function calculates the position and velocity with respect
% to International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) from Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF). 
% The algorithm is based on IAU-2006/2000, CIO based reduction. 
% The benefit of using CIO approach is
% because there are fewer ambiguities, and it has less reliance on EOP
% values. In addition, it is easier to generate long series for
% interpolation from CIO series.
% CIO formulation includes the frame bias.
% NOTE: ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) is an ECEF (Earth Centered, Earth Fixed) frame of reference 
%     : GCRF (Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame) frame of reference is an ECI (Earth-centered inertial) frame of reference

% * FOR FUTURE, CHECK IF IERS HAS RELEASED NEW DATA FOR X,Y and s QUANTITIES *
% * NOTE: The function internally calls a function that uses persistent variables. 'persistent' variable maintains its value even after executing a function, for 
% new analysis use 'clear all' to get rid of any persistent variable and values that might have been stored during previous run * 
% The ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) is an ECEF (Earth Centered, Earth Fixed) frame of reference, i.e., a non-inertial frame of reference where the origin is 
% placed at the center of mass of Earth, and the frame rotates with respect to the stars to remain fixed with respect to the Earth surface as it rotates. 
% The Z-axis extends along the true North as defined by the IERS reference pole, and the X-axis extends towards the intersection between the equator 
% and the Greenwich meridian at any time.
% The GCRF (Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame) frame of reference is an Earth-centered inertial coordinate frame, where the origin is also placed at the center of mass of Earth 
% and the coordinate frame is fixed with respect to the stars (and therefore not fixed with respect to the Earth surface in its rotation). 
% The X-axis is aligned with the mean equinox of Earth at 12:00 Terrestrial Time on the 1st of January, 2000, and the Z-axis is aligned with the EarthÂ´s rotation axis.
