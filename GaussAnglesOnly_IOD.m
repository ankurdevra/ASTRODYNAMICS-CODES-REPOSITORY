%% FUNCTION DESCRIPTION:
% The following function is an Initial Orbit Determination algorithm known
% as Gauss Angle only algorithm
% used to determine the ECI position and velocity of
% an orbiting body by solely relying on three sequential optical measurements
% that yields sequential Right Ascension and Declination of the orbiting
% body from three different or same site location.
% This method works best when the data points have a angular seperation of
% 10 deg or less or about 5-10 min apart in LEO.
% The output ECI position and velocity will be associated with the middle
% observation
